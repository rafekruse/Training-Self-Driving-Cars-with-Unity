# Training-Self-Driving-Cars-with-Unity


This project is a simulator for training cars, controlled by [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), to navigate a maze. Cars improve by means of a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) that simulates real world natural selection.
